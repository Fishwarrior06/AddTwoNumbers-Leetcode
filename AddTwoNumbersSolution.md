Here's the solution to the Add Two Numbers problem from Leetcode.

## QUESTION
In this question we are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reversed order** and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and then return the sum as a linked list.

**Constrains**
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range ```[1, 100]```.
- ```0 <= Node.val <= 9```
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
